- a training set.  This contains historical contracts that we knew the outcomes of (this is as of 2019).  The dependent variable that we are interested in here is “is_dead”.
- a prediction set.  You will use your trained model to predict the outcomes of “is_dead” for these data.
- a key. This explains the columns in the data.
