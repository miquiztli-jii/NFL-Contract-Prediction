# X10 - Interview Challenge - Data Analyst

## Question

Predict the probability that a player will play under the contract in each remaining year of his deal.

## Data

Attached is an excel file with 3 tabs:
- a training set.  This contains historical contracts that we knew the outcomes of (this is as of 2019).  The dependent variable that we are interested in here is “is_dead”.
- a prediction set.  You will use your trained model to predict the outcomes of “is_dead” for these data.
- a key. This explains the columns in the data

I have also attached a pdf that explains where the data is from on spotrac

## Goal 

Please use a Jupyter notebook and python 3.6-3.9 to complete the challenge, and email me your notebook when completed and we can set up some time to go through it together.
Please dont use outside data - if you think there is extra data needed, let me know and we can discuss.  The goal is to NOT use their performance data and purely rely on their contract information for this.

There are no right or wrong answers, the purpose is to assess your problem-solving skills within the Python/Jupyter framework.
